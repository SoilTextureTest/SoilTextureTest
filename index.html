<h2>What is SoilTextureTest?</h2>
    <p>SoilTextureTest is, in essence, a quiz that attempts to assign the type of material without you actually tasting it or evaluating it. You will be presented by a statement, and then you will answer with your opinion on the statement, from <b>Strongly Agree</b> to <b>Strongly Disagree</b>, with each answer slightly affecting your scores. At the end of the quiz, your answers will be compared to real life materials according to the Soil Texture Compass, thus giving you a percentage. Answer honestly!<br /><br />
    There are <b><u><span id="numOfQuestions"></span></u></b> questions in the test.</p>

<h2>What are the axes?</h2>
    <p>There are four independent axes - they are:</p>
   
    <p class="value-description"><b style="color:#cf822b;">Sand Composite</b><br/>
       This axis evaluates how many sand, or rock-like substances are consisted within your material.</p>
    <br>

    <p class="value-description"><b style="color:#a88525;">Clay Composite</b><br/>
        This axis evaluates how many clay is consisted within your material.</p>
    <br>

    <p class="value-description"><b style="color:#007514;">Silt Composite</b><br/>
        This axis evaluates how many Silt, or substances similar to that of quartz or watery substances are consisted within your material.</p>
    <br>

    <p class="value-description"><b style="color:#0288d1;">Loose vs Solid</b><br/>
        This axis aims to evaluate how solid the material is, or in other words, how dense the structure is.</p>
    
<h2>What's the "Closest Match" mean at the bottom of the results?</h2>
    <p>In addition to matching you to the eight values, the quiz also attempts to match you to a political ideology. This is a work in progress and is much less accurate than the actual machines, so don't take it too seriously. If you disagree with your assigned ideology, fill in this <a href="https://forms.gle/7wjTxVXZqdxktWWD9">form</a>, and we'll look into adjusting the system. Thanks!</p>

<h2>I don't like my scores!</h2>
